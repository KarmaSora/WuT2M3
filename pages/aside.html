                Journey through the Lands Between, a new fantasy world created by Hidetaka Miyazaki,
                creator of the infl uential DARK SOULS video game series, and George R. R. Martin,
                author of The New York Times best-selling fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire.
                Unravel the mysteries of the Elden Rings power. Encounter adversaries with profound backgrounds,
                characters with their own unique motivations for helping or hindering your progress, and fearsome
                creatures.

       
                Elden Ring is an action role-playing game played in a third person perspective, with gameplay focusing
                on
                combat and exploration.
                It features elements similar to those found in other games developed by FromSoftware, such as the Dark
                Souls
                series, Bloodborne,
                and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Set in an open world, players are allowed to freely explore the Lands
                Between
                and its six main areas;
                these locations range from Limgrave, an area featuring grassy plains and ancient ruins, to Caelid, a
                wasteland home to undead monsters.
                [1] Open world areas are explorable using the character's mount, Torrent, as the primary mode of
                transportation,
                along with the ability to fast travel outside of combat. Throughout the game, players encounter
                non-player
                characters (NPCs) and enemies,
                including the demigods who rule each main area and serve as the game's main bosses.[2][3] Aside from
                open
                world areas, Elden Ring also features hidden dungeons,
                such as catacombs, tunnels, and caves where players can fight bosses and gather helpful items.[4]
                The player chooses a character class at the start of the game, which determines their starting spells,
                equipment, and attributes.
                [5] Combat with enemies can be within melee range, or from a distance using ranged weapons or spells.
                Attacks from enemies can be blocked using shields or avoided by dodging.
                Spells in Elden Ring allow the player to enhance their own weapons, fight enemies from afar, and restore
                lost hit points. The player can memorize a limited amount of these spells, which can be cast using a
                staff
                or Sacred Seal item.[6][7] Weapons in Elden Ring can be improved using Ashes of War, obtainable
                "enchantments" that grant weapons new capabilities. Ashes of War can be applied to or removed from
                weapons,
                and each Ash adds a Weapon Art, a special ability that can be used during combat.[8] Aside from direct
                combat, stealth mechanics can be used to avoid enemies entirely, or allow for the targeting of foes with
                critical hits while hidden.[9][10]

                Checkpoints called Sites of Grace are located throughout the game's areas; they are places where the
                character can increase the power of their attributes, change memorized spells, swap Ashes of War, or
                walk to
                using fast travel. Upon death, players respawn at the last Site of Grace they interacted with.
                Alternatively, they may choose to respawn at certain locations highlighted by "Stakes of Marika"
                provided
                they died nearby.[8][11][12][13] To increase their attributes at Sites of Grace, the player must spend
                runes, an in-game currency acquired by defeating enemies.[14] Runes can also be used to buy items and
                improve weapons and armor. Dying in Elden Ring will cause the player to lose all collected runes at the
                location of death, and if the player dies again before retrieving the runes, they will be lost
                forever.[15]

                The game contains crafting mechanics, which require materials in order to create items. To craft a
                certain
                item, the player must have the item's crafting recipe. Recipes can be found inside collectibles called
                Cookbooks, which are scattered throughout the world. Materials can be collected by defeating enemies,
                exploring the game's world, or by trading with merchant NPCs. Crafted items range from poison darts and
                exploding pots, to consumables that temporarily increase the player's strength in combat.[16][17]
                Similar to
                the Dark Souls games, the player can summon friendly NPCs called spirits to fight enemies.[18] Each type
                of
                summonable spirit requires its equivalent Spirit Ash for summoning; different types of Spirit Ashes can
                be
                discovered as the player explores the game world. Spirits can only be summoned near structures called
                Rebirth Monuments, which are primarily found in large areas and inside boss fight arenas.[19]

                Elden Ring has a multiplayer system that allows players to be summoned for both cooperative and player
                versus player (PvP) play over the Internet.[20] Cooperative play involves the placing of a Summon Sign
                on
                the ground, which causes the sign to appear in the world of online players who have used a corresponding
                item. If another player interacts with the sign, whoever placed down the sign is summoned into their
                world.
                Cooperative players remain in the same world until the boss of the area is defeated, or until a summoned
                player dies and is sent back to their home world. PvP combat involves using a Summon Sign to directly
                challenge another player to a duel, or using additional items to invade the worlds of others. World
                hosts
                may also use a "Taunter's Tongue" to increase the likelihood that their world will be invaded by others,
                as
                well as decreasing the time between invasions.
